BIT MANIPULATION

This project contains C functions for bit manipulation.

Files
The following files are included in this project:

0-binary_to_uint.c
This file contains the function binary_to_uint, which converts a binary number to an unsigned integer.

1-print_binary.c
This file contains the function print_binary, which prints the binary representation of a number.

2-get_bit.c
This file contains the function get_bit, which gets the value of a bit at a given index.

3-set_bit.c
This file contains the function set_bit, which sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4-clear_bit.c
This file contains the function clear_bit, which sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5-flip_bits.c
This file contains the function flip_bits, which returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

100-get_endianness.c
This file contains the function get_endianness, which checks the endianness of the system.

main.h
This header file contains the function prototypes for all the Bit manipulation functions.

Usage
To use these functions, you can include the main.h header file in your C code and call the functions as needed.
